Notes: finalproject.cpp and finalproject.h are cleaned up and commented versions of our code that we did not get to compile. 
In the unlikely event where our reformatted code fails to compile, we have included backup.cpp and backup.h, 
which are versions of our code that we know will compile successfully. You will have to do then copy the code from the two backup files 
and replace the current code in both the .cpp and .h files.
